# McClane Simulator

A text-based adventure where you get to be John McClane and saved the day in a procedurally generated world!

## About

Originally worked on by Graham Barber and Damian Kulp (and maybe others, can't remember) for CodeDay 2016 in Portland.

## Dev

This modern remake of our classic game is simple to run and develop!

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm i` to get the packages.
3. Run `npm start` to see the project running locally

## Tech stack

The actual game was created completely from scratch - no game engine!

Dev is handled by TypeScript, gulp, and BrowserSync for compiling, running, and hot-reloading.

Enjoy!
